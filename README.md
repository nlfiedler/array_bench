# Array Benchmarks

## Overview

This simple Rust application is used to run benchmarks on several resizable array implementations.

## Usage

Install a recent version of the Rust toolchain and use the command(s) below to run the tests:

```shell
cargo run --release
```

Each benchmark is run several times and an average (excluding the high and low) is computed.

## Supported Rust Versions

The Rust edition is set to `2024` and hence version `1.85.0` is the minimum supported version.
